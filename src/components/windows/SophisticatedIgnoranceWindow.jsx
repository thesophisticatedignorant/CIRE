                Sophisticated Ignorance is a <strong>fashion house</strong> at the intersection of <em>refinement</em> and <em>rebellion</em>, where the <em>trickle-up</em> and <em>trickle-down</em> theories of luxury collide. Rooted in the ethos of <em>The Architecture of Self</em>, it explores identity, hierarchy, and ascension through chess symbolism — from Pawn to King. Ignorance represents the evolution of street luxury into an aspirational art form — <em>New-Vieux Riche</em> in spirit, and unapologetically bold in execution.
